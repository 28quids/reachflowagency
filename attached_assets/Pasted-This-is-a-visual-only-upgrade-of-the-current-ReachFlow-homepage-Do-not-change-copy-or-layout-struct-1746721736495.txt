This is a visual-only upgrade of the current ReachFlow homepage.
Do not change copy or layout structure.
The goal is to make the entire page feel more dynamic, high-converting, and modern, while keeping it clean and on-brand.

🔸 GLOBAL STYLING CHANGES
Typography Hierarchy

Make section titles like “What We Do,” “Featured Projects,” and “Get Your Free Marketing Audit” stand out visually.

Use larger font size (e.g., 32–40px desktop)

Increase font weight or add slight letter spacing

Optional: use a different display font just for headers

Add orange label-style subheaders above key titles (small, uppercase, 600 weight, e.g. "OUR SERVICES")

Drop Shadows for Depth

Add soft box shadows to:

Card containers (e.g. service blocks, project cards, form)

Phone mockup images

Navigation bar (on scroll only)

Use subtle elevation (e.g., rgba(0,0,0,0.06) blur 12px) to avoid visual clutter

Section Background Contrast

Add faint light-gray or light-orange gradient background fills behind alternating sections

Example: “What We Do” section should sit on a faint off-white or peach-toned background

Use radial orange blur accents tucked in corners behind key visuals (especially “What We Do,” “Form,” “Hero”)

Load-In Animations

Add section-wide fade-in + upward float animations for:

Hero headline and CTA

Section headers

Cards (staggered per column)

Images/mockups (fade + slight zoom)

Animation should trigger once on scroll into viewport

🔹 HERO SECTION IMPROVEMENTS
Add a large orange blur glow or gradient blob behind the “Get A Free Audit” button

CTA button:

On hover: soft glow or subtle 1–2px upward shift

Text weight increased slightly for punch

Add a shadow and 3D-like lift to floating UI pieces (notification, charts)

🔹 “WHAT WE DO” Section
Use card-style service containers with background fill (white or very light gray)

Each card:

Box shadow for lift

Rounded corners (12px)

Add hover effect: scale 1.02 and shadow deepen

Title text: larger + bolder

Section background: light gradient (peach → white, subtle)

🔹 THE REACHFLOW EXPERIENCE
Turn each experience step (Slack, Loom, Iteration) into its own elevated info card

Add icons inside soft-colored circles (background tinted orange)

Add card background fill, rounded corners, shadow

Use matching visual system to the “What We Do” service cards

Optional: Animate each in with 0.2s staggered delay

🔹 PROJECT CARDS
Add hover animation to each:

Shadow deepen

Image scale up slightly (1.03)

Top-left badge ("Lead Gen", "Audit") should float and animate in (fade down)

Add a soft wave or blur in the background of this section for subtle energy

🔹 FORM SECTION
Add drop shadow and slight border radius to form container

Background: slight gradient or off-white tint to help it pop from surrounding sections

CTA button:

Make larger and bolder

Use bright orange gradient

On hover: light animation (pulse or slight scale)

🔹 FOOTER
Add a soft top border or wave divider

Slightly reduce text size

Bring in subtle footer icons hover effect (color change or glow)

✅ MOBILE RESPONSIVENESS
Ensure all shadows, rounded containers, and gradients scale down naturally

Maintain spacing between floating elements (icons, cards, buttons)

Avoid excessive text stacking by increasing padding

BONUS ✨ OPTIONAL VISUAL ENHANCEMENTS
Introduce very subtle floating animation (CSS keyframe up/down drift) to decorative blobs or icons
