// Redesign the "Featured Projects" section on the ReachFlow site as follows:

// ‚úÖ Layout: Create a two-column section:
// Left column = a featured project (case study box)
// Right column = vertically scrolling list of past projects

// Styling & spacing: Padding around section (min 4rem top/bottom), grid layout with gap-8 or equivalent, responsive for mobile/tablet

// üüß Use ReachFlow‚Äôs orange/coral brand as the accent for buttons and section headers
// ‚ö™Ô∏è Keep background white or very light coral tint, with subtle grid dot or line pattern behind for depth

// ---------- LEFT SIDE: FEATURED PROJECT ----------
/*
Create a card-style featured project with:

- Title: "Featured Case Study"
- Project Name: "Green Home Path"
- Subtitle: ‚Äú10,000+ Qualified Energy Leads Captured‚Äù
- 2‚Äì3 line summary:

  "We built a custom lead system that scraped location- and problem-specific homeowners interested in heat pump installation. These leads were resold profitably to local contractors ‚Äî now over 10,000 captured and counting."

- Add small orange pill label: ‚ÄúLead Gen System‚Äù
- Include CTA button: "See How We Did It ‚Üí"
- Button styled in coral/orange with soft shadow, hover effect
- Optional: phone or browser mockup frame if easy, else keep minimal and text-driven
*/

// ---------- RIGHT SIDE: SCROLLING PROJECT LIST ----------
/*
To the right of the case study, build a vertical list that scrolls upward every 5 seconds automatically.

Each list item should be:
- A simple name with a subtle tag label underneath (use grey pills)
- Stagger animations slightly for elegance
- Limit visible items to 3‚Äì4 at once (rest scroll into view)

Client names and labels:
1. Juger Clothing ‚Äî "DTC Fashion Brand"
2. Thompson Towers ‚Äî "Event Venue Funnel"
3. Nvision Shades ‚Äî "Product Pre-Launch"
4. Trading IQ ‚Äî "Investor-Focused Waitlist"
5. Clarity Supplements ‚Äî "Ad Campaign Build"
6. You? ‚Äî "Next Case Study In Progress"

- Add an icon or arrow before the list if needed
- On mobile, stack the featured case and the list vertically
*/

// ---------- SECTION HEADER ----------
/*
Above the grid, add a centered section header:
- Title: "Where We've Made an Impact"
- Subtitle (lighter): ‚ÄúReal brands. Real results.‚Äù
