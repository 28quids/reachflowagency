Apply a site-wide visual UI upgrade to the current ReachFlow homepage.
Do not change layout structure or copy — this is strictly a visual and styling refinement.
The goal is to bring the UI quality to match premium landing pages like LeadChoice (reference uploaded), making the site feel sharper, more confident, and more professional.

🔹 GLOBAL DESIGN SYSTEM

Spacing & Grid

Apply consistent section padding:

100px top/bottom desktop, 64px mobile

Animate in as a slider on desktop, stacked on mobile
