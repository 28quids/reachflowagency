Add a new visual content section directly beneath the hero CTA.
The purpose is to visually reinforce the promise of qualified lead bookings and contact validation using a modern, techy aesthetic.

🔹 Section Structure
Full-width container with soft light background (slightly off-white or very light beige to contrast the white of the hero)

Centered layout featuring a large iPhone-style phone mockup as the centerpiece

Two floating visual elements on each side of the phone:

Left side: calendar-style UI card

Right side: contact validation card with profile images + checkmarks

🔸 Layout Details
1. Phone Mockup (Center)
Use a stylized phone or device mockup centered on desktop, full-width on mobile

Inside the screen, display:

Large digital clock (e.g., 11:56)

Date line (e.g., “Dec 11, Monday”)

Below the time, show push-style notifications (2 stacked):

Icon: notification bell or app logo

Title: “You’ve booked a new qualified meeting!”

Timestamp (e.g., “1m ago”)

Style these notifications like iOS native alerts: light shadow, soft rounding

2. Left Card — Calendar
White card styled like a modern date picker/calendar

Use 5×5 grid of light grey boxes with checkmarked blue squares sprinkled throughout

Subtle drop shadow + rounded corners

Floating beside the phone (mobile: stack vertically)

3. Right Card — Contact Verification
White card with 3 horizontal contact blocks stacked

Each contains:

Circular profile image (placeholder image or avatar)

Name line + optional message line

Right side: blue checkmark or verification tick

Third contact row has no checkmark (dimmed) to visually reinforce the “qualified” theme

🔸 Styling Instructions
Add fade-up animation on section load (slight delay between phone and side cards)

Use drop shadows on all 3 UI elements (phone + cards) to give floating depth

Place a soft orange blur or radial gradient in the background, behind and slightly below the phone

Mobile responsiveness:

Stack phone mockup above

Calendar and contacts stack below side-by-side or full-width blocks

🔹 Top of Section Text (Optional)
Place above the visuals (centered text block):

⭐️ Rated 4.9/5 by 30+ businesses

Small star rating graphic

Slightly smaller font than hero, subdued color (dark grey or charcoal)

✅ Purpose
This visual block builds trust + outcome clarity right after the hero — it makes the promise of real leads and booked calls tangible without relying on just copy.
