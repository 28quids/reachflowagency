Apply a visual redesign to the current ReachFlow audit page (/audit) without changing layout structure or copy.
Reference: original Playstate audit page design (uploaded screenshot).
The goal is to elevate polish, contrast, and visual impact using ReachFlow’s soft tech aesthetic (light, modern, coral/orange theme).

🔸 GLOBAL STYLING
Typography:

Use Inter, Satoshi, or similar clean sans-serif

Hero and section headings: 36–44px desktop, bold weight (700+), tight line spacing

Subhead/body: dark gray (#222), high legibility

Add orange taglines (e.g. EXPERIENCED TEAM, SIMPLE & EFFECTIVE) in uppercase, letter-spaced labels above key sections

Colors:

Background: pure white (#ffffff)

Accents: ReachFlow gradient coral-orange (#FF6B2C → #FF9444)

Shadows: subtle soft shadow (e.g. rgba(0,0,0,0.06)) behind all card blocks

Text: black or charcoal for contrast (#1c1c1c)

Spacing:

Add more vertical space between sections (80–100px desktop)

Use more consistent section containers with max-width: 1140px

Hover Effects:

CTA buttons: slight lift on hover, drop shadow glow

Cards: increase elevation and scale slightly on hover

Icons/pills: fade-in hover transitions

🎯 HERO SECTION UPGRADES
Add a subtle peach/orange radial gradient background blob behind the form and CTA area

Animate form and bullet points with scroll-based fade-in (staggered left and right)

Add floating UI shapes or icons as visual interest — notification bubbles, tick icons, graph markers, etc

Bold the phrase “Get Your Free Audit” above the hero in orange smallcaps

🔥 “WHAT’S COSTING YOU / WHAT YOU COULD HAVE” BLOCK
Turn both boxes into cards with elevated styling:

Rounded corners

Light background gradient or white with inset shadows

Each list item has a matching red X or green check with a coral icon badge

Right card includes a floating coral CTA button (pop hover + arrow icon)

📊 “OUR AUDIT PROCESS” SECTION
Rebuild into 3 card-style process blocks:

Icons in circle badge (orange background, white icon)

Cards float above faint peach wave or radial background

Scroll animation: fade-up with stagger delay

Section header has an orange sublabel: SIMPLE & EFFECTIVE

💡 “WHY TRUST REACHFLOW” SECTION
Add clear 4-card grid layout with elevation/shadow on each

Orange header pill: EXPERIENCED TEAM

Right stat card:

Highlight “10,000+ Leads Generated”

Use orange checkmarks for:

✓ 24/7 Lead Gen

✓ Modern Website

✓ Traffic Control

Add a faint gradient background glow

📈 “NO MORE LEADS LEFT ON THE TABLE” SECTION
Left column:

Each number badge in large orange circle (consistent sizing)

Align text tightly

Right column (form):

Match hero form styling

Add a light orange radial background blur behind the card

Under form: 3 mini trust icons (check, shield, stars) with coral gradient icon + dark text

⚙️ SITE-WIDE POLISH
Add entrance animations:

All sections scroll in (fade-up, fade-left, or fade-scale)

CTA buttons pulse once on load

Accent shapes:

Add 3D-style blobs, floating pill elements, blurred shapes in corners (see Playstate ref)

Minimal, but adds polish and depth
