Apply a visual redesign to the ReachFlow audit page (/audit) that blends the layout and copy from the current version with the visual styling and background depth of the original Playstate lander (see uploaded image).
Use ReachFlow's modern coral/orange branding, but reintroduce the subtle visual drama: grid texture, light motion, and 3D depth.

üî≤ GLOBAL BACKGROUND + DEPTH ELEMENTS
Implement a custom background system to elevate page quality and depth:

‚úÖ Subtle Grid Background:

Add a light, glowing grid pattern as the main page background.

Use a very soft #fdf2eb or #f7f7f7 base color with a low-opacity orange-tinted grid pattern overlaid.

The grid should feel faint but present ‚Äî not distracting ‚Äî and have a subtle radial gradient fade near the hero and CTA blocks.

‚úÖ 3D Floating Elements:

Add lightly blurred, floating UI icons or elements positioned absolutely across sections:

Checkmarks, small window mockups, arrows, form input icons

Slight blur and motion on scroll preferred

Orange accent color #FF6B2C, or translucent coral

‚úÖ Radial Glow Blurs:

Behind each major section (e.g. hero, CTA, audit cards), place blurred background blobs:

Coral/orange radial fade (rgba(255, 107, 44, 0.08))

Use CSS filters or SVG blur shapes

Add light gradient flares from corners to simulate ambient glow

‚úÖ Animated Section Entrances:

Each card and section block should fade in with scale on scroll

Use scroll-fade-up or scroll-zoom-in animations with slight stagger

üü† SECTION-BY-SECTION STYLE ENHANCEMENTS (retain current layout & copy)
1. HERO SECTION
Use the grid background behind everything

Add a faint orange radial blur behind the headline + CTA

Include 2‚Äì3 floating UI elements (e.g. checklist icon, mobile mockup, paper plane) around the form and headline

The ‚ÄúGreat Service / Great Customers‚Äù text should have a gradient text-fill in ReachFlow‚Äôs coral-orange

Form gets:

Rounded corners

Soft white shadow

Button has subtle orange glow on hover

2. ‚ÄúTHE BEST BUSINESSES‚Ä¶‚Äù SECTION
Wrap both cards inside a section with a subtle peach-tinted glow overlay

Add shadow depth to each card with floating X/checkmark icons

CTA in right card should glow on hover

3. AUDIT PROCESS
Add grid lines in background behind cards

Each process step should sit on a glowing soft white tile with orange icon badge

Animate cards on scroll (fade-up staggered)

4. WHY TRUST REACHFLOW
Add a floating trust badge element (e.g. 5-star icon, clipboard, calendar) subtly faded into background

Stat card ("10,000+ Leads") should have glowing gradient behind it with soft shadow

5. NO MORE LEADS SECTION
Left-side steps:

Number badges should be coral gradient circles with light shadows

Right-side form:

Add a faint radial blur behind the whole form card

Under form:

Add icon-based trust badges with coral icon + dark text
