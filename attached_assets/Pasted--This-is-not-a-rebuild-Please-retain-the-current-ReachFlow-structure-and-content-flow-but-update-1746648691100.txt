⚠️ This is not a rebuild.
Please retain the current ReachFlow structure and content flow, but update the layout and section UI to reflect the visual clarity, UX polish, and responsive layout behavior of the reference site provided. Do not copy their color scheme, branding, or copywriting.

🔹 Global & Base Styling
Use ReachFlow's existing orange/white color palette

Retain white/light backgrounds, but add depth and visual interest throughout:

Add light orange blurs (CSS blur-style background elements) behind key sections

Use soft floating wave shapes or gradient overlays behind headers/CTA areas

Add drop shadows to cards, buttons, and form inputs for depth

Use rounded corners (8–12px radius) for containers and buttons

🔹 Header / Hero Section
Keep current ReachFlow headline + subhead and CTA button layout, but apply new structural formatting:

Center-align headline and CTA block

Increase vertical spacing between headline, subtext, and button

Add a floating orange blur background effect behind the content (subtle but noticeable)

CTA button should:

Have a soft orange gradient

On hover: increase brightness and add subtle drop shadow

Add a simple, modern phone mockup or dashboard visual beside or under the headline (similar to the inspiration site, but use your own mockups or image blocks)

Section should animate in with a fade-up + scale in on page load

🔸 Brand Logo Row (Under Hero)
Convert your "Brands We’ve Worked With" section into a horizontal row of grayscale logos

Use consistent sizing and spacing

Add subtle grayscale-to-color hover effect

Center-aligned, sits directly under hero section with clear padding

Add horizontal divider line or slight background shift for separation

🔹 “What We Do” Service Section
Convert this into card-based layout with clear icon, service name, and description

Use a 3-column layout on desktop, 1-column stack on mobile

Cards should:

Have slight box shadows

Use soft fade-in and float-up animation on load (staggered timing per card)

Be clickable (if you want service deep links later)

Optional: add subtle background wave or light coral blur behind this section for visual layering

🔹 Process Section ("How It Works")
Convert current process steps into a horizontal progress-style section

3 boxes (Discovery, Implementation, Optimization) with icons above

Each step should:

Have a step number

Small header

1–2 line description

Uniform card height

Add connecting lines or subtle progress dots between them on desktop

Animate with sequential slide-in from left-right with easing

🔹 Featured Projects Section
Convert current project grid into a horizontally scrollable row of featured mockups

Each card has:

Project image (mockup or screenshot in a phone/frame)

Project name

Tag/label (e.g. “Lead Gen”, “Landing Page”)

1-line outcome or win

Use shadow and floating animation on hover

Cards animate in from the sides on scroll using fade + slide effect

Add floating orange wave or gradient line behind this section for visual break

🔹 CTA Form (Audit Request)
Keep existing form structure but apply these layout updates:

Increase spacing between form elements

Add drop shadows and border radius to input fields

Use 2-column layout where screen size allows

Highlight form section with a subtle background tint or white card container

Submit button:

Full width on mobile

Soft gradient orange background

Text: “Get My Free Audit – Delivered in 48hrs”

Hover effect: glow or slight scale-in

Add form entrance animation (fade + scale on scroll into view)

🔹 Footer
Use same layout as current but:

Slightly tighten spacing and padding

Add soft top divider or wave

Add animation: fade-up on load

Keep footer text and contact minimal (logo, nav, email only)

🔁 Load-In Animation Rules (Global)
Apply animations per section using these rules:

Hero Section: fade up + scale

Brand Logos: fade in staggered

Service Cards: fade + float up staggered

Process Steps: slide in from side

Project Cards: fade + hover float

Form Section: fade in + slight zoom

Footer: fade up

Use smooth, subtle animation timing (0.4–0.6s) with ease-in-out curves. Ensure performance is mobile-friendly.

Final Notes:
Maintain responsiveness and readability across devices

Don’t remove or rearrange any of the current homepage sections unless specified

Prioritize loading performance and clean class structure for future updates
